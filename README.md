# GoogleMapsToSheets
Pulls info from Google Maps (using the Google Places API) into a Google Sheet

This Google Apps Script uses the Google Places API to get place info from Google Maps into a Google Sheet. This can be used for any number of reasons, however it was born out of an interest to automate the process of building Google MyMaps.

For a given row where the cell in column E is empty, the script will search for what is entered in column A (ie. the place name). In its current form, it will return a JSON and parse it for the address, phone number, website, Google Maps URL, and business hours. Additional search paramters are listed here:

You will need to create a Google API Key.
You can get an API key from Google API Console. Basically, you need to:
1. Create a project in Google API Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started?supportedpurview=project
2. Enable APIs that your project will access (in our case Google Maps API and Google Sheets API);
3. Generate an API key for the project (you can have multiple keys, and can set various restrictionsâ€”e.g. the key can be used only from certain websites/domains).
4. Use this API key in your JavaScript code.

The script is run with a cusom menu on the Google Sheet called Get Place Info.
    
To use this with Google MyMap, you will import your Google Sheet as a layer and choose the address and name columns when asked where to place and how to name your markers.
